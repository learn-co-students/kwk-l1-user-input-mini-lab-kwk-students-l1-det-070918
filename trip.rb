# Code your prompts here!

# First, puts out a string asking where the tourist would like to stay.
puts "Let's plan your trip! Where would you like to stay?"

stay = gets.chomp.capitalize  

#don't forget to Capitilize the input

# Do the same thing with `eats` and one last time with `nights`, capturing their text input and storing them to the respective local variable

puts "what kind of food you would like?"
eat = gets.chomp

puts "where would u like to stay for the night?"
nights = gets.chomp.capitalize
